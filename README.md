# Knowledge Gap and Novel Idea Identification System

## Purpose
This program identifies gaps in knowledge and generates novel ideas by analyzing large volumes of text data. It categorizes knowledge into structured domains, classes, and tasks, detects underrepresented areas, and either fills these gaps with validated information or flags them as novel ideas for user exploration.

## Features
- **Knowledge Categorization**: Classifies text into hierarchical structures (domains, classes, tasks).
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Detects missing or underrepresented areas in the knowledge base.
- **Novel Idea Generation**: Flags gaps as novel ideas when no relevant information is found online.
- **Internet Search Integration**: Retrieves missing information using external search tools.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Continuously refines the knowledge base.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd knowledge-gap-identifier
```
5. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your input text data and candidate labels.
2. Run the program:
```bash
python knowledge_gap_identifier.py
```
3. View the knowledge base and novel ideas in the console output.

## Example
Input texts:
- "Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field with applications in cryptography."
- "Machine learning techniques are widely used in healthcare for predictive analysis."

Candidate labels:
- "Quantum Computing"
- "Machine Learning"
- "Healthcare"
- "Cryptography"

Output:
- Knowledge Base: Categorized summaries of the input texts.
- Novel Ideas: Identified gaps in knowledge.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for a list of dependencies.
